# ManchesterUnited_Clone_Page
Trying to clone the page only with HTML and CSS for practicing
With % for width,there is just enough width for column if i try to have margin for spacing item,it affects the row and push the item down
ex: i use width : 33.33333% if i changed to 30% ,there would be enough space but that's not what i really want so i kinda confused
is it possible i'm kinda newbie
